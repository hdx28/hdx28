          <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
          <p>
            Building an community to host your own eSports competitions, build a membership community and monetize.

            We worked closely with the team to turn their ambitious product concept into a ready-for-the-market
            prototype with a unique brand identity that needed to be “intriguing”, “reserved & understated” and
            “purposeful & mindful”.
          </p>
          <h2>The UX Challenges</h2>
          <p>
            The project had a number of product challenges that needed to be addressed with smart user experience
            deliverables. One of them was keeping the platform fair and engaging, without involving a traditional
            payment system. How do we make people “deposit” and “exchange” their most valuable asset, build trust and
            spark curiosity, without overwhelming with a heavy onboarding flow. After a number of UX tests, we created a
            unique internal Flok currency system that was easily adopted by all demographics.

            The onboarding was split in a number of intuitive actions to ensure account completion and activation. We
            also designed a few hook cycles to bring back users repeatedly, so the team doesn’t need to rely on
            aggressive retention campaigns.

            Building an community to host your own eSports competitions, build a membership community and monetize.

            We worked closely with the team to turn their ambitious product concept into a ready-for-the-market

            The project had a number of product challenges that needed to be addressed with smart user experience
            deliverables. One of them was keeping the platform fair and engaging, without involving a traditional
            payment system. How do we make people “deposit” and “exchange” their most valuable asset, build trust and
            spark curiosity, without overwhelming with a heavy onboarding flow. After a number of UX tests, we created a
            unique internal Flok currency system that was easily adopted by all demographics.

            The onboarding was split in a number of intuitive actions to ensure account completion and activation. We
            also designed a few hook cycles to bring back users repeatedly, so the team doesn’t need to rely on
            aggressive retention campaigns.

            Sometimes five Imprimaturs are seen together dialogue-wise in the
            piazza of one title-page, complimenting and ducking each to other
            with their shaven reverences, whether the author, who stands by in
            perplexity at the foot of his epistle, shall to the press or to
            the sponge. These are the pretty responsories, these are the dear
            antiphonies, that so bewitched of late our prelates and their
            chaplains with the goodly echo they made; and besotted us to the
            gay imitation of a lordly Imprimatur, one from Lambeth House,
            another from the west end of Paul's.
          </p>
          <p>
            So apishly Romanizing, that the word of command still was set down
            in Latin; as if the learned grammatical pen that wrote it would
            cast no ink without Latin; or perhaps, as they thought, because no
            vulgar tongue was worthy to express the pure conceit of an
            Imprimatur, but rather, as I hope, for that our English, the
            language of men ever famous and foremost in the achievements of
            liberty, will not easily find servile letters enow to spell such a
            dictatory presumption English.

            They are not skilful considerers of human things, who imagine to
            remove sin by removing the matter of sin; for, besides that it is
            a huge heap increasing under the very act of diminishing, though
            some part of it may for a time be withdrawn from some persons, it
            cannot from all, in such a universal thing as books are; and when
            this is done, yet the sin remains entire. Though ye take from a
            covetous man all his treasure, he has yet one jewel left, ye
            cannot bereave him of his covetousness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Banish all objects of lust, shut up all youth into the severest
            discipline that can be exercised in any hermitage, ye cannot make
            them chaste, that came not hither so; such great care and wisdom
            is required to the right managing of this point. Suppose we could
            expel sin by this means; look how much we thus expel of sin, so
            much we expel of virtue: for the matter of them both is the same;
            remove that, and ye remove them both alike.

          <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
          <p>
            Building an community to host your own eSports competitions, build a membership community and monetize.

            We worked closely with the team to turn their ambitious product concept into a ready-for-the-market
            prototype with a unique brand identity that needed to be “intriguing”, “reserved & understated” and
            “purposeful & mindful”.

          <h2>The UX Challenges</h2>
          <p>
            The project had a number of product challenges that needed to be addressed with smart user experience
            deliverables. One of them was keeping the platform fair and engaging, without involving a traditional
            payment system. How do we make people “deposit” and “exchange” their most valuable asset, build trust and
            spark curiosity, without overwhelming with a heavy onboarding flow. After a number of UX tests, we created a
            unique internal Flok currency system that was easily adopted by all demographics.

            The onboarding was split in a number of intuitive actions to ensure account completion and activation. We
            also designed a few hook cycles to bring back users repeatedly, so the team doesn’t need to rely on
            aggressive retention campaigns.
